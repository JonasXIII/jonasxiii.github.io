                            This is where you write your story. You can talk about a meaningful experience,
                            a trip you took, or an important moment in your life. Replace this text with your own story.

                            Here's another story with the image on the right side. This creates a nice alternating
                            pattern as you scroll down the page. Add as many of these as you'd like!

                            Use this layout for particularly important stories or when you have a wide, beautiful
                            photo that deserves to be shown at full width. The text appears below the image in
                            this style.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </article>

                <!-- Example Post 4: Text only (no image) -->
                <article class="post-card post-text-only">
                    <div class="post-content">
                        <h2 class="post-title">A Thought or Reflection</h2>
                        <p class="post-date">Month Year</p>
                        <p class="post-text">
                            Sometimes you might want to share thoughts or reflections without an image.
                            This layout is perfect for that. You can write longer passages here without
                            needing to include a photo.
